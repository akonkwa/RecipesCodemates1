# Sesame Chicken with Bok Choy & Jasmine Rice

## Servings: 2 servings

## Time to prepare: 40 minutes

## Ingredients:

10 oz Chopped Chicken Breast
½ cup Jasmine Rice
2 Cloves Garlic
2 Scallions
½ lb Bok Choy
3 Tbsps Cornstarch
3 Tbsps Soy Glaze
2 Tbsps Rice Vinegar
2 Tbsps Sesame Oil
1 tsp Black & White Sesame Seeds
¼ tsp Crushed Red Pepper Flakes

## Equipment needed:

Non-stick pan
Small pot
Wooden spoon
Tongs

## Steps for preparation:

1. Cook the rice
In a small pot, combine the rice, a big pinch of salt and 1 cup of water; heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, cover and reduce the heat to low. Cook 12 to 14 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed and the rice is tender. Remove from heat and fluff the cooked rice with a fork. Stir in ¼ of the vinegar.

2. Prepare the ingredients
While the rice cooks, wash and dry the fresh produce. Cut off and discard the root end of the bok choy; roughly chop the leaves and stems. Peel and mince the garlic. Cut off and discard the root ends of the scallions; thinly slice, separating the white bottoms and green tops.

3. Cook the bok choy
While the rice continues to cook, in a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the bok choy and garlic; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes, or until the bok choy is bright green and slightly wilted. Transfer to a plate and season with salt and pepper to taste. Wipe out the pan.

4. Coak & coat the chicken
Pat the chicken dry with paper towels and place in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper; toss to coat. Add the cornstarch; toss to thoroughly coat. In the same pan, heat a thin layer of oil on high until hot. Once the oil is hot enough that a pinch of cornstarch sizzles immediately when added to the pan, add the coated chicken (shaking off any excess cornstarch) in a single, even layer. Cook 3 to 5 minutes on the first side, or until golden brown. Turn and cook, without stirring, 2 to 3 minutes, or until browned and cooked through.

5. Finish the chicken & bok choy
Reduce the heat to medium-high. To the pan, add the cooked bok choy, white bottoms of the scallions, soy glaze, remaining vinegar, sesame oil, half the sesame seeds, ¼ cup of water and as much of the red pepper flakes as you’d like, depending on how spicy you’d like the dish to be. Cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes, or until well combined and the chicken and bok choy are thoroughly coated. Remove from heat; season with salt and pepper to taste

6. Plate your dish and garnish with coriander 


### Notes:
